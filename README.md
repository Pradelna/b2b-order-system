# ðŸ§º <a id="project-overview">Project Overview</a>

This project is a web-based platform developed for a laundry service, aimed at managing customer orders, delivery logistics, invoicing, and status tracking. It also transmits order data to an external service via API for efficient courier management. Built with a Django REST Framework backend and a modern React + TypeScript frontend (via Vite), the system supports both administrators and clients with role-based access control.

### ðŸš€ Key Features
- Clients can place and track orders through a responsive web interface.
- Orders are automatically duplicated for multiple days using background Celery tasks.
- Real-time integration with a third-party API for courier management.
- Regular status synchronization and photo reporting.
- Admin panel for managing users, couriers, invoices, and order flows.
- Role-based access control for clients and admins.
- Dockerized environment for easy deployment and isolation.
- Continuous integration and delivery via GitHub Actions.
- Background processing with Celery and Redis.
- MinIO for file and photo storage.
- Secure and production-ready with SSL, DNS configuration, and automated maintenance scripts.
